# Project Chimera — Snapshot

**Last Touched:** `2026-05-01`

## Current Phase
**Phase 5 — Polish & 1.0** (Months 25-31 of GDD roadmap)

Phases 0–4 are code-complete. Phase 5 is underway. Session 20 shipped worker-placed buildings + UI bug sweep. Session 21 (remote, away from computer) shipped Utility AI + Adaptive Input Delay.

## Next Action
**Build + smoke test the two systems written this session (see checklist below), then drop in audio assets.**

1. Run `dotnet build` in `godot/` — expect 0 errors.
2. Run the Utility AI smoke test (see checklist).
3. Run the Adaptive Delay smoke test (see checklist).
4. Drop `.ogg` files at `res://resources/audio/sfx/`.

## Needs Testing — Written This Session

### ✅ Utility AI (`src/AI/AiOpponentSystem.cs`)

Full replacement of the rigid 3-phase FSM with utility scoring. All public API unchanged — `MainScene` needs no changes.

**Smoke test (single machine, Play mode):**
- [ ] Open any skirmish map in Play mode. Watch the P2 AI.
- [ ] **Early game**: AI should build a Barracks within ~20s of having 100 ore.
- [ ] **Tech progression**: after the Barracks is complete, AI should eventually build an ArcheryRange (requires Barracks complete), then SiegeWorkshop (requires ArcheryRange complete). Watch Godot Output for `[Lockstep]` / AI build logs to confirm order.
- [ ] **Supply expansion**: when AI supply headroom ≤ 4, it should build a CommandCenter before queuing more units (score 0.95 = highest priority).
- [ ] **Double production**: after the expansion CC is complete, AI should build a second Barracks.
- [ ] **Attack waves**: P2 combat units should periodically attack-move toward P1 base. Easy = fewer waves (threshold 8), Hard = more frequent (threshold 3).
- [ ] **Scenario pre-placed buildings**: load `map_06_contested_peaks` (pre-placed Barracks). AI should immediately train from it — verify units appear without AI needing to build its own Barracks first.
- [ ] **Destroyed Barracks recovery**: destroy P2's Barracks in-game. AI should score `BuildBarracks = 0.85` and rebuild without getting stuck in a reset loop.

**Difficulty smoke test:**
- [ ] Set `AiLevel = Easy` in Inspector → AI attacks late, small waves.
- [ ] Set `AiLevel = Hard` → AI teches up fast, attacks early and often.

### ✅ Adaptive Input Delay (`src/Multiplayer/LockstepManager.cs` + `NetworkCommand.cs`)

RTT measurement via Ping/Pong + negotiated delay changes via DelayProposal packets. `INPUT_DELAY = 4` is still the starting value; the constant is preserved for documentation.

**Build check:**
- [ ] `dotnet build` — 0 errors, 0 new warnings.

**Offline smoke test (single machine):**
- [ ] Launch game in Play mode (offline). No pings should be sent (only fires when `IsOnline`). No errors in Output.

**LAN smoke test (two machines required — do alongside P2.4 LAN test):**
- [ ] Host + join on LAN. Watch Godot Output on both machines.
- [ ] Within 2s of match start: both machines should log `[Lockstep] RTT sample: Xms` and a smoothed RTT.
- [ ] On LAN (~1-5ms RTT): target delay = `ceil(2.5ms / 33ms) + 1 = 2`. Both machines should log `[Lockstep] Delay: 4 → 2 ticks` within ~5s.
- [ ] Play for 300+ ticks. Checksums must stay in sync (same HUD hash on both machines). The delay reduction must NOT cause desync.
- [ ] Optionally: to test high-latency path, add artificial latency (e.g. `tc netem` on Linux) and verify delay increases toward MAX_DELAY=12.

**HUD wiring (optional, low priority):**
- The `CurrentDelay` property is now public. You can display it in the HUD stall indicator: e.g. `"Delay: {_lockstep.CurrentDelay} ticks"` alongside the "Waiting for peer…" banner. Not required for correctness — just a nice debug display.

## What's In Progress
Nothing blocking — both systems written but untested (written while away from computer).

## Phase 5 Remaining Items
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Drop in audio .ogg files | 📋 | `res://resources/audio/sfx/` — AudioManager already wired |
| mod.io Inspector setup | 📋 | Select MainScene → set `Mod Io Game Id` + `Mod Io Api Key`; walkthrough at `docs/modio-setup-guide.md` |
| P2.4 LAN test (P2P mode) | 📋 | FlowFieldBridge active, verify checksums stay in sync through 300+ ticks |
| P0.3 Iron Pact art | 📋 | Hunyuan3D or Tripo — 8 GLBs to replace box placeholders (external work) |
| Terrain texture painting | 📋 | Set Terrain3D textures via Godot Inspector (Terrain3D → Assets) — procedural via ClassDB doesn't persist |
| Utility AI decision system | 🔨 | Written — needs smoke test (see checklist above) |
| AI build order + attack timing logic | ✅ | Covered by utility scoring (tech tree, supply, aggression weights) |

| Linux export | 📋 | Export template only — no code changes |
| 1.0 release | 📋 | Final milestone |

## Mental RAM
- **Current stack**: Godot 4.6.2 stable, C# / .NET 8, ECS-inspired simulation (custom SoA arrays, not a framework)
- **Rendering**: MultiMeshInstance3D for all unit rendering; two MultiMesh nodes per faction (separate colors)
- **Pathfinding**: `FlowFieldBridge` is the live path bridge (replaced `PathRequestSystem`). `PathRequestSystem` stays unused as fallback. Flow fields are deterministic — required for lockstep.
- **Networking**: Deterministic lockstep complete. `_currentDelay` starts at 4 and adapts via Ping/Pong RTT measurement + `DelayProposal` negotiation. Target delay = `ceil(OWL/33ms) + 1`, clamped [2, 12]. Both peers must agree before a change applies (`CommitDelayChange` pre-seeds gap ticks on delay increase). `INPUT_DELAY=4` is preserved as the start value constant. `CurrentDelay` property is public for HUD display.
- **Worker construction**: workers walk to site (`UnitCommand.Build` + `BuildTarget[]` SoA), building ticks its own construction timer autonomously, worker arrival clears command + resumes gathering.
- **`CommandCardSystem` worker card** fires `OnWorkerBuildRequested` → `MainScene` owns placement mode. `_Input` (not `_UnhandledInput`) for placement intercept — beats SelectionSystem.
- **`SettingsPanel`** uses intermediate `anchorRoot` Control (MouseFilter=Stop) for full-screen input blocking; Escape in `_Input`.
- **Terrain brush**: panel at (10,155) below HUD; `IsOverPanel()` guard stops paint on slider clicks; `ApplyBrushSettings()` in `ContinuePaint()` for live slider updates.
- **Supply cap**: dynamic — base 10 + 10 per alive CommandCenter. `TrainUnit()` supply-gates before deducting ore.
- **`AiDifficulty`**: Easy(8 units/40s), Normal(5/25s), Hard(3/15s). `[Export] AiLevel` on MainScene.
- **Assembly name**: `ProjectChimera` (csproj + project.godot must match or scripts won't load)
- **`PathRequestSystem` owns Move→Stop transition** (NOT Move→Idle) — Move→Idle caused stutter bug (TickIdleCombat re-wrote MoveTarget on very next sim tick)

## Open Design Decisions
- **AI art tool**: Hunyuan3D vs Tripo vs other — P0.3 Iron Pact art still pending

## Performance Baseline
| Configuration | FPS |
|---|---|
| Movement only, 500 units | ~1150 |
| Combat O(n²), 500 units | ~300 |
| Combat O(n²), 1000 units | ~50 |
| Combat + SpatialHash, 1000 units | ~350 |

## Key Architecture Decisions
- ECS-inspired simulation: SoA arrays, free list, no framework. Pure C# sim layer — no Godot types.
- NavigationServer3D direct API (no NavigationAgent3D nodes). FlowFieldBridge for deterministic multiplayer.
- Fog of war: 128×128 byte grid, R8 ImageTexture uploaded each frame by FogOfWarBridge.
- Buildings use `BuildingStore` SoA (not EntityWorld) — buildings don't move or attack.
- `PathRequestSystem` lives in presentation layer; sim layer only reads MoveTarget.
- `AiOpponentSystem` runs LAST in SimulationLoop — sees fully-updated supply caps and construction states.
- Tech tree: `prerequisites` string[] on `UnitDefinition`; checked by `TechTreeChecker.AreMet()`.
- Scenario system: `[Export] string ScenarioPath` on MainScene — map swappable from Inspector.
- Lockstep: `LockstepManager` pure C# (no Godot dep); bridges via `OnRequestPath/OnRequestAttackMove/OnCancelPath` delegates.
- Replay: `.chmr` binary format. Auto-starts on `OnMatchStart()`. `ReplayPlayer` re-applies stored orders.
- Nakama matchmaking: `NakamaService.FindMatchAsync()` — 2-player, `game=chimera_1v1`. Faction assigned by server.
