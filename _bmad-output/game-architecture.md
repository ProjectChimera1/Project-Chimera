# Game Architecture

## Document Status

This is the **forward-looking** technical architecture for Project Chimera — the decisions
that keep AI agents implementing consistently on the path to 1.0. It is created through the
GDS Architecture Workflow and is informed by, but distinct from, the brownfield
`architecture.md` (which documents the code **as-built**, deep scan 2026-06-05).

**Steps Completed:** 3 of 9 (Engine & Framework)

**In progress:** Step 4 (Architectural Decisions) — decision map agreed; next action is **D1
(effects-primitive vocabulary)**. Full Step 4 working state in **`game-architecture.RESUME.md`**.

## Project Context

### Game Overview

**Project Chimera** is an RTS *creation platform* — "the platform that ships the RTS
genre as a living, community-owned system" — built in Godot 4.6.2 stable (.NET) with C#.
It serves three archetypes (Commanders play, Architects build, Tinkerers do both) and
filters every feature through three questions: does it make an RTS easier to **Create**,
**Share**, or **Discover**?

The shipped game (a polished 2-faction single-player + multiplayer RTS) is the **showcase**;
the **Warcraft III World Editor–class, AI-assisted Creation Suite is the North Star**
(PRD Decision #5). 1.0 is scoped **maximal** — full creation suite, AI-assisted authoring,
multiplayer, and UGC ship together, gated by always-shippable internal milestones M0–M6.

### Technical Scope

- **Platform:** PC desktop — **Windows primary, Linux** (dedicated server + client). No web,
  mobile, console, VR, or gamepad.
- **Engine / Language:** Godot **4.6.2 stable** (Forward+, Jolt, D3D12) · **C# / .NET 8**
  desktop (".NET 9 AOT" is a future aspiration, not 1.0). Sole NuGet dependency: `NakamaClient`.
- **Genre:** Real-time strategy + in-game creation toolset (editor-as-product).
- **Project Level:** **4 — Maximum.** Multiplayer-deterministic simulation + full data-driven
  creation suite + LLM-assisted authoring, on a **brownfield codebase at Phase 5 (→1.0)**.
  Phases 0–4 code-complete; the creation-suite editors, trigger-DSL expansion, hero save/load,
  and >2-player multiplayer are net-new.
- **Distribution:** Premium one-time purchase (no F2P/live-service); **Steam + direct DRM-free**.

### Technical Requirements

**Performance:** 500–2,000 units @ **60 FPS render / 30 Hz sim tick**, verified on representative
shipped + community scenarios (NFR-5, FR-46). Hard entity cap **4096** — do not raise for benchmark
reasons (explicit counter-metric).

**Creation-suite UX:** Edit↔Play round-trip **≤ 2s**, no restart/export (NFR-1). First faction
authored **≤ 12 min**, first scenario **< 15 min**, no JSON required (NFR-2, FR-4).

**Networking:** Server-authoritative **deterministic lockstep**, command-based (~20 B/command);
adaptive input delay clamped **[2, 12]** ticks; **up to 8 players**; **≥ 95% zero-desync**; LAN
**300+ ticks checksummed** in lockstep is a hard ship gate (FR-39); checksums every 60 ticks.
Transport: ENet (LAN/P2P) + dedicated Linux server; Nakama matchmaking.

**Determinism:** 16.16 fixed-point throughout sim; no float gameplay math, no wall-clock,
ascending-ID iteration, seeded RNG. (NavigationServer3D paths are non-deterministic cross-machine —
flow-field mitigation is in place but **unproven on real LAN**.)

**Validation:** every shared construct (units, abilities, triggers, DSL logic, custom UI) must be
**statically server-validatable** before multiplayer execution — this directly **bounds DSL
expressiveness** (NFR-6).

**Security:** server authority + command validation + content hashing. No client-side anti-cheat.

### Complexity Drivers

**High complexity**
- Deterministic lockstep MP that has **never been LAN-verified** (NavServer3D nondeterminism risk).
- **Trigger-DSL expansion** bounded by static validation — the expressiveness lever for "build any game."
- ~6 net-new editors threading through the **2,200-LOC `MainScene`** composition root (integration chokepoint).
- Hero persistent artifacts as **init-time deterministic** state with server validation.

**Novel concepts (no off-the-shelf pattern)**
- ❓ **Effects-primitive vocabulary** shared by abilities AND triggers — deferred to this phase; breadth determines buildable genres.
- A runtime, data-driven, **multiplayer-deterministic** creation suite where creator content is server-validated.
- LLM-assisted authoring (NL→trigger, AI map gen, AI balance) as a sandboxed authoring layer that **never touches the sim tick**.
- Creator-authored **custom runtime UI** bound to DSL variables.

### Technical Risks

- **#1 ship risk:** LAN determinism verification (FR-39) — code-complete, unproven.
- **DSL Goldilocks:** too narrow → "any game" fails; too broad → unvalidatable / breaks determinism.
- **Zero tests** vs. a determinism-regression-guard requirement — test infra is an M1 prerequisite.
- **Data-driven debt:** `DamageMatrix` hardcoded (→ JSON before creator balance authoring); resources hardcoded; tech-tree only string-arrays.
- **AI clamps:** map generator hard-clamps to RTS conventions — must parameterize for TD/RPG.
- **`GraphEdit` is "Experimental"** (tech-tree + trigger graphs) — needs an abstraction layer.
- **Terrain3D runtime modification** not stress-tested under rapid brush + collider updates.

## Engine & Framework

### Selected Engine

**Godot 4.6.x stable** (.NET build) · **C# / .NET 8** — locked (brownfield).

**Rationale (GDD §2, confirmed as-built):** C# runs the RTS sim hot path ~2–3× faster than
GDScript JIT; Godot's runtime introspection (`GetPropertyList`/`Get`/`Set`, runtime
`PackedScene.Pack()`, `GraphEdit` at runtime) is *the* reason an in-game creation suite is
viable; MIT license (no royalties/seat fees); native headless/dedicated-server export.

**Version decision (2026-06-20):** Adopt **Godot 4.6.3** for 1.0 (patch on the 4.6 line,
released 2026-05-20 — low-risk bugfixes over 4.6.2). **Defer 4.7** (released 2026-06-17) to
post-1.0: a days-old minor carries regression + addon-compat (Terrain3D, godot-mcp) risk not
worth taking mid-release. Engine stays pinned to a known-good line.

### Project Initialization

Existing project — no scaffolding. Entry: `project.godot` → `res://scenes/main.tscn` →
`MainScene.cs._Ready()`. Solution `godot/godot.sln` (.NET 8). Sole NuGet dependency: `NakamaClient`.

### Engine-Provided Architecture

| Component | Solution | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rendering | Forward+; `MultiMeshInstance3D` for all units | 1 draw call/unit-type/faction; sim→transform via `*Bridge` |
| Physics | Jolt (engine default) | **NOT for gameplay** — sim uses deterministic `SpatialHash`; Jolt for editor/raycast/presentation only |
| Audio | `AudioServer` / `AudioStreamPlayer` | Presentation layer only |
| Input | `Input` + `InputMap` | Presentation only; maps to sim *command intents*, never mutates sim |
| Scene mgmt | Scene tree + `PackedScene`; `MainScene` composition root; autoload `MCPGameBridge` | Runtime `PackedScene.Pack()` powers editor save/load |
| UI | `Control` nodes + `Theme` | Claude Design System → faceted `StyleBox` theme |
| Networking transport | `ENetMultiplayerPeer` (+ WebSocket fallback) | Custom deterministic lockstep layered on top |
| Build / export | .NET 8 MSBuild + Godot export templates; `--headless` / `dedicated_server` (Linux) | NativeAOT server build is an open question |
| Serialization | `System.Text.Json` (data) + custom binary (`.chmr`, terrain) | .NET, not engine-provided |

### AI Tooling (MCP Servers)

- **godot-mcp (already in use, keep)** — rich Godot MCP via the `MCPGameBridge` autoload
  (`addons/godot_mcp`): live scene/node/animation/tilemap/gridmap edits, `runtime_state` digests,
  profiler, `validate_meshes`, input injection, frozen game-time stepping, `godot_docs`. The
  AI-assisted-dev backbone. **Dev-time tooling only — not shipped in the 1.0 build.** Hygiene:
  verify the addon still connects after the 4.6.3 bump (patch bumps rarely break editor addons)
  and pull upstream fixes periodically.
- **Context7** (optional, `upstash/context7`) — current .NET/NuGet/library docs (Nakama,
  System.Text.Json): `claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`.

### Remaining Architectural Decisions (→ Step 4)

Engine settles rendering/physics/input/scene/transport. These game-specific decisions remain:

1. **Effects-primitive vocabulary** shared by abilities + triggers (the "buildable genres" lever)
2. **Trigger-DSL design** — variables/loops/arrays/events/custom UI + static-validation model
3. **Data-driven definition schema & loader** — `DamageMatrix`→JSON, N-resources, tech trees
4. **Hero persistence** — init-time deterministic state + server validation
5. **>2-player lockstep** topology + Nakama matchmaking (up to 8)
6. **Test architecture** — GdUnit4 + headless deterministic sim tests (from zero)
7. **`MainScene` decomposition** — taming the 2,200-LOC composition root
8. **LLM provider config** migration (Inspector export → settings) + multi-provider
